> Colored coins can be created to repurpose Bitcoin or altcoins (alternatives to Bitcoin) to create digital assets that represent other things of value.

> the color is generally not a real-world quality; the metaphorical coloring is the addition of metadata.

> This metadata makes it possible to repurpose the original cryptocurrency. This means that a data-based coin in a digital wallet can be used as a backing for a contract or a certificate for redemption. That use benefits from the coinâ€™s security and verifiability of ownership, as well as the convenience of digital transactions. Some examples of things a colored coin may be repurposed to represent include amounts of gold in game currency or shares in a company. They could also be used to create a currency within a currency.
